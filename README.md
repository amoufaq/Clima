# Clima
Clima is a weather application inspired by the stunning designs crafted by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). By the end of the project, we had the capability to access real-time weather information for your device's current location and for any city worldwide!


## My Goal

The objective of this project was to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. We looked at how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet.
